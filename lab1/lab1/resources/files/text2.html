Now, computers computers let's have a look at implementing the SHA-512 hashing algorithm in Java.
First, we have to understand the concept of salt. Simply put, this is a random sequence that is generated for each new hash.
By introducing this randomness, we increase the hash's entropy, and we protect our database against pre-compiled lists of hashes known as rainbow tables.
Our new hash function then becomes roughly
