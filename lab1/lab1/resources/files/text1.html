As computers increase  in power, and as we find new vulnerabilities, then researchers derive new versions of SHA.
Newer versions have a progressively longer length, or sometimes researchers publish a new version of the underlying algorithm.
SHA-512 represents the longest key in the third generation of the algorithm.
While there are now more secure versions of SHA, SHA-512 is the strongest that is implemented in Java
